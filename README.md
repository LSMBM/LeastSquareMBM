# Least Square Moment Balanced Machine (LSMBM)
LSMBM enhances the conventional LSSVM approach by adding the concept of moment as a data weighting mechanism to identify the optimal hyperplane. The weight assigned to each datapoint is determined using the backpropagation neural network (BPNN), allowing the model to focus on more-reliable data.
